-- From the docs;
-- Tables are the sole data-structuring mechanism in Lua;
-- they can be used to represent ordinary arrays, lists,
--  symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, etc. 
-- To represent records, Lua uses the field name as an index.
-- The language supports this representation by providing
-- a.name as syntactic sugar for a["name"]. There are several
-- convenient ways to create tables in Lua (see ยง3.4.9).

-- A table in Lua is an object in more than one sense.
-- Like objects, tables have a state. Like objects, 
-- tables have an identity (a selfness) that is independent
-- of their values; specifically, two objects (tables) with
-- the same value are different objects, whereas an object
-- can have different values at different times, but it is always
-- the same object. Like objects, tables have a life cycle that 
-- is independent of who created them or where they were created.

-- tables also serve as objects in lua
-- this is one of the syntaxes, you can also specify the 'self'
-- argument explicitly but then you have to pass it every time
-- you call the method which seems worse
Account = {balance = 0}

        self.balance = self.balance - v
    end

Account.balance = 50
Account:withdraw(5)                 -- syntax 1
Account.withdraw(Account, 5)        -- syntax 2
print(Account.balance)

-- and keeping with the theme of tables being everything,
-- we can also make it serve as a class by giving it 
-- a constructor
