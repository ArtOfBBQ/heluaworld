# Description

This casual RTS game (in the making) started out as my 'hello world' project for lua. I was planning to try out several programming languages by writing a tiny hello world app in each. It turns out I actually really like the Lua language, so this will turn out to be a much bigger app.

Disclaimer: I am not a game dev - I'm an AI and stats guy. Until we get to the AI part, everything I'm doing here is completely new to me. I'm trying to improve my ability, not make the next StarCraft.
